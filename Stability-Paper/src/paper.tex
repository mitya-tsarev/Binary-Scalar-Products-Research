\begin{abstract}
    Recent results show that, in some sense, 2-level polytopes cannot simultaneously have many vertices and many facets. In this work we find the maximal possible product of the number of vertices and the number of facets in a 2-level polytope that is not affinely isomorphic to the cube or the cross-polytope, resolving a strong form of the conjecture by Bohn, Faenza, Fiorini, Fisikopoulos, Macchia, and Pashkovich (2015). To do this we show the stability of Kupavskii's and Weltge's upper bound on $\left|\aaa\right|\cdot\left|\bb\right|$ for $\aaa,\bb \subseteq \R^d$ with a property that $\forall a \in \aaa, b \in \bb$ the scalar product $\la a, b\ra \in\{0,1\}$.
    % Feels a bit too pretentious, might need to remove "resolving...(2015)" part, or at least replace "strong form" by "strengthened version"
